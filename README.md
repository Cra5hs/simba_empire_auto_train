**Feature:**
```
Auto train if
1. Win rate > 70% (U can customize)
2. Reward if win is medium or high (U can customize)
3. Monster's level >= Pet's level - 1
```


**How to start:**

1.  Install nodejs
2.  Open terminal and ```cd {simba_empire_auto_train folder}```
3.  Find server/fight.js

Edit:

```
private key = metamask => Account => Account details => Export private key

**Let's go auto train **
```
//0: Low
//1: Medium
//2: High

//Sample: just only fight if reward is high
var fight_reward = [1, 2]; 
```

```
//Just only fight if win percent >= 75%
var min_win_percent = 75;
```

```
var wallet = {
  address: "Your address",
  private_key: "Your private key"
};
```

5.  ```npm install```
6.  ```npm run start:proc```
